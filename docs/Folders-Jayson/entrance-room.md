# The main hall
After an introduction prologue to te game, you enter "Blackwood Manor". naturally the first room you're in is "The main hall". This is where the game starts.

## Mini story about room
The grand entrance of the mansion, with a majestic staircase leading to the second floor. Dusty chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and faded portraits adorn the walls. There is a looming atmosphere in the air, as if the walls themselves hold secrets.

This is the first room of the game. As you enter, you are greeted by Edward, the butler at Blackwood Manor. He will tell you a little about the mansion, and you will also learn that there is a safe in the main hall containing "the truth".

After examining an item in the room, you can interact with it. 

## Crucial items information:
- Item needed to proceed to next room: "key". Can be found: in flowerpot.
- Item Needed to Finish the game: (first) part of the 4 digit code, needed to open the save in this room, the other 3 numbers can be found in the other 3 rooms. can be found: Behind painting (after cutting away the painting with 'old knife')

## Rest of items and their use:
- *Flashlight*. Can be found: in 'cabinet'. Use is yet to be defined.
- *Old knife*. Can be found: underneath 'Old carpet'. Can be used to cut out the painting, to find first part of code.
- *Edwards pocket square*. Can be found: inbetween Couch cushens. Is used to give (on interact) to Edward to unlock the riddle.
 
## Interactible objects in room: 
- *Edward*: Welcomes you to 'Blackwood Manor'. When you choose to interact with Edward, he'll ask you to find his pocket square. Once you've found his pocket square in/on The couch, he'll tell you a riddle.
- *Couch*: Can be examined, and interacted with. When interacting with the couch you find Edwards pocket square.
- *Flowerpot*: Can be examined and interacter with. When interacting with the flowerpot you find the key to the next room.
- *Old carpet*: Any interaction with this object unlocks after you solve the Riddle presented by Edward. After 'interact' action on 'Old carpet' you find and pick up 'old Knife'.
- *Cabinet*: can be examined and interacted with. after interacting, you find and pick up 'Flashlight.
- *Painting*: can be examined and interacted with. Examining the painting gives u the hint that something could be behind it. Interacting gives u a hint that the painting frame can't be moved, you should find another way to see what's behind the painting. After you find the 'Old knife' you can retry interacting with the painting, this cuts the paper out of the frame.
- *Vault*: can be examined and interacted with. without the correct 4 digit code, you can't open this vault, so each time you interact with the vault when not having the correct code, you get the hint that you should find the 4 digit code so you can open the vault. Once you have the correct 4 digit code, you can interact with the vault again. Once the vault opens, you go into a "cutscene" which contains "the truth". This is where the game ends.


## Riddle (By edward)
"In a room of silence and the passing of time,  
Where secrets slumber, hidden under our climb.  
Beneath our feet, a sea of fibers fine,  
A woven blanket, where we tread, so pure and prime.  
Soft and smooth, it stretches across the floor,  
A path of dust and threads, a treasure to explore.    

The object i'm talking about is a(n): '<input answer>'"  

Het antwoord op dit raadsel is "carpet".

Bij een fout antwoord geeft Edward je een platte hand, doet 5% damage.  
Bij een goed antwoord word tapijt toegevoegd als interactable, waarmee je een oud mes vind die belangrijk is.
